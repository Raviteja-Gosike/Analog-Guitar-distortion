# Analog Guitar Distortion Pedal

A diode-based analog distortion circuit designed and implemented as part of the **Principles and Applications of Electrical Engineering** course. This project explores waveform clipping techniques to generate guitar distortion effects without the use of microcontrollers.

## Project Description

This project aims to design and study an analog circuit capable of producing signal distortion effects commonly used in music production. By utilizing diode clipper circuits along with high-pass and low-pass filters, the circuit can achieve both soft and hard clipping, resulting in characteristic distortion sounds.

The design employs operational amplifiers (Op-amps), diodes, resistors, capacitors, and other passive components. The circuit filters unwanted noise and shapes the output waveform based on component values, with practical demonstrations through simulation and hardware testing.

## Objectives

- Design an analog distortion circuit using Op-amps and diodes  
- Implement soft and hard clipping configurations  
- Study the impact of component variations on waveform distortion  
- Simulate circuit behavior and validate results through experimentation  
- Explore practical applications for electric guitars without embedded controllers

## Background

Diodes, semiconductor devices that conduct current in one direction, are used to clip signal waveforms based on their cutoff voltage. In forward bias, they maintain a constant voltage drop (approximately 0.7 V for silicon diodes), allowing controlled clipping.

### Clipping Types:
- **Soft Clipping:** Utilizes diodes in opposite directions in the Op-amp feedback loop to round off signal peaks, producing smoother distortion tones.
- **Hard Clipping:** Connects diodes to ground, chopping off waveform peaks to create square-like waves and harsher distortion.

This project integrates both clipping methods to offer versatile distortion effects.

## Implementation Overview

### Circuit Configuration
1. Input is filtered and connected to the non-inverting terminal of the first Op-amp.
2. Gain is controlled through a variable resistor in the feedback loop.
3. The output passes through filtering elements before entering a second Op-amp.
4. Soft clipping is achieved with diodes and resistors in parallel across the feedback loop.
5. Hard clipping is implemented at the output stage with additional diode networks.
6. Filters remove unwanted noise and smooth the waveform.

### Testing and Validation
- Input from a signal generator was clipped as expected with controlled amplitude.
- Real-world guitar signals produced noticeable distortion through speaker output.
- LTSpice simulations confirmed gain variations and frequency response behavior.
